Excellent 👌
Let’s prepare **Slide 7: Access Control** — an essential topic to help students understand **visibility levels** in Java, especially when combined with packages.

We'll make this slide **clean and structured** with:

* 📝 Left: Bullet explanation of modifiers
* 📊 Right: A **visibility comparison table** to make it crystal clear.

### 🟦 **Slide 7: Access Control**

**📝 Slide Content (PPT - Left Column):**

```
• Access modifiers control the visibility of classes, methods & variables  
• Java provides four levels of access control:
   - public → accessible from anywhere
   - protected → accessible within package & subclasses
   - (default) → accessible only within the same package
   - private → accessible only within the class
• Helps in encapsulation and secure code design
```

### 📊 **Access Modifier Table (Right Column)**

| Modifier      | Same Class | Same Package | Subclass | Other Packages |
| ------------- | ---------- | ------------ | -------- | -------------- |
| **public**    | ✅          | ✅            | ✅        | ✅              |
| **protected** | ✅          | ✅            | ✅        | ❌              |
| **(default)** | ✅          | ✅            | ❌        | ❌              |
| **private**   | ✅          | ❌            | ❌        | ❌              |

✅ **Legend:**
✅ = Accessible  ❌ = Not Accessible

### 💻 **Code Example (Short)**

```java
package com.example;
public class Person {
    public String name;
    protected int age;
    String city;          // default
    private String secret;
}
```

```java
package com.other;
import com.example.Person;

public class AccessTest extends Person {
    public void demo() {
        System.out.println(name);   // ✅ public
        System.out.println(age);    // ✅ protected (subclass)
        // System.out.println(city);   ❌ default - different package
        // System.out.println(secret); ❌ private
    }
}
```

### 🟨 **Trainer Notes (Explanation):**

> * **Access control** is all about **where** a field or method can be accessed from.
> * **`public`** is visible to everyone; **`private`** is visible only inside the class.
> * **`protected`** is visible inside the same package and to subclasses in other packages.
> * **default (package-private)** is the **default when no modifier is used**, and it's **visible only within the same package**.
> * This system enforces **encapsulation** — hiding unnecessary details and exposing only what is needed.
> * In real-world projects, most fields are **private** with **public getters/setters**, maintaining data integrity.

💡 *Tip:* Draw arrows between “package” boxes to illustrate access visually.
